# What is NSMGR CLI Tool
My own personal code playground to implement simple operations on csproj files with relation to nuget packages
Nautilus CLI is (well from the name) is a command line tool.
Just imagine if you have more than 10 projects (*in my case i have several solutions that have 20-40 projects in it*) in a Visual Studio solution, and you want to only update specific nuget packages. It will be a nightmare! 

Perhaps this tool can help you!

Oh btw, There's always room for improvements, after all we are just human beings. We do our best. If there bugs, we fix.

### v1.1 Current release and status
Current version is **v1.1** which is already obsolete, but still usable. It is not tested with latest .NET Core.

### v2.1 Release status
A lot has changed in **v2.1** since it was first published. For example cli executable file name changed from **nautilus-cli** to **nsmgr** and many other items. The changes are needed to support even wider stuff in the future, at the same time preserve existing code base where necessary.
